## :books: Conclusions 

|Name|Conclusion|
|---|---|
|**Chavez Lopez Eduardo Guillermo**|This work took a long time since it is the first in which we use Concluence, but in addition to that, we had to evaluate the Scrum methodology and apply phase one in our project, which took a large part of our time in addition to contemplating various approaches. so that phase one could meet the requested requirements; but without a doubt it was a pleasant experience to be able to develop this document.|
|**Dominguez Cervantes Daniel Ivan**|For the preparation of this work, the work carried out during this period had to be reviewed, to determine what would be used to be compared with the other work that the team has and if necessary, make corrections or improvements to include it in this work, which took us some time since there were several of the works that we have done and discuss how we were going to integrate them, taking into account what you ask for in the SCRUM start-up phase.|
|**Flores Aguila David Antonio**|It is a relief to have found a tool like Confluence, it makes teamwork much easier, it is intuitive and quite efficient. I usually find it tedious to have to work in the markdown format, so opening up to new options that are more comfortable will always be an excellent experience.|
|**Valadez Camacho Gustavo**|During this activity, we collect information regarding the project. Taking into account the team members and the distribution of roles, and the necessary information of the project to present to the future client. This type of team activity, when developed in Confluence, allows us a better organization, since it allows us to work in real time, and almost completely with the tools and plugins it contains. However, I consider that we need a little more time with this tool to be able to exploit its full potential.|
|**Vazquez Osuna Laura Michelle**|Thanks to the execution of this work we managed to review which are the important points of our project, what are the points that we should be careful about, just as we managed to express, according to expenses, the real price of our project and which is the most expensive element. We also define which model we will use for navigation on the platform.|
