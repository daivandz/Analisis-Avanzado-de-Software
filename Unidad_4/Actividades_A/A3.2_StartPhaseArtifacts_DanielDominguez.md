## :books: Conclusions 

|Name|Conclusion|
|---|---|
|**Chavez Lopez Eduardo Guillermo**|Elaborating this document took us a lot of work and time, in addition to also generating some problems when choosing epics, since although it may seem simple, we had to determine which were the fundamental activities and roles to carry out each epic, as well as their respective user stories and their extra data, but despite everything I think we did a good job choosing and putting the relevant information for each epic; I also have to say that making the scrumboard was fun although it was also a bit time consuming, but I am happy with the work we did; In addition, for my part, I can also say that this work made us see that we were progressing in the best way with the project.|
|**Dominguez Cervantes Daniel Ivan**|In this work, teamwork was more relevant because we met on several occasions to be able to discuss and agree on the elaboration of epics and user stories. It took us some time to agree on which epics and user stories we were going to put to work. Once we had the epics and user stories, we met again to choose the priority of each epic, this step did not take us that long so it was faster to do this part of the work. In the end, I was able to observe how the teamwork made the epics and user stories to be elaborated in a simpler and more understandable way, in addition to assigning a priority to each of the epics, each one of the team was able to give their point of view. from different perspectives on each epic and based on that, vote on the priority that would be assigned to each one.|
|**Flores Aguila David Antonio**|The dynamics of these works are quite interesting, being honest, we do not always agree between all the members of the team to carry out a job, but to carry out this project we are periodically meeting to progress together with the work and make sure that all contribute equally. Although, not all of us can work at the same time, we all assign parts to ourselves in order to contribute together.|
|**Valadez Camacho Gustavo**|Some of us have already worked with the SCRUM method on other projects, but in a very superficial way. Even using Planning Poker, but through an app and in a face-to-face meeting, instead of using an online platform. But this activity allowed us to understand its operation a little more in depth, since we did not knew methods to calculate the priority such as MoSCoW, nor some of the tools that we could use to create both the Product Backlog and the SCRUM Board. Finding tools like Miro allowed us to develop a SCRUM Board with a design as similar as possible to how it would be done in a company, and allowed us to develop it in real time as a team.|
|**Vazquez Osuna Laura Michelle**|In carrying out the task, we separated all the steps into epics and users that our project may have, detailing it by these same parts created, we also did a lot of work to see which steps depended on others and of course pass these to the srum, personally, I take it as something entertaining and even interesting to move these sticky notes to see the progress of our project, since they will move from to be done to completed.|
