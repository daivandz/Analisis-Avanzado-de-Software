## :books: Conclusions 

|Name|Conclusion|
|---|---|
|**Chavez Lopez Eduardo Guillermo**|This was one of the most difficult jobs to do as we had to break down every user story from our first Sprint; We had to see which tasks were the most appropriate for each story and arrange them according to the dependencies that each one had; Another thing that was also difficult was to see that we all worked every day to maximize time and resources, likewise, when we implemented the gantt chart we realized that the distribution by days and team workers was correct, as well as all the work in general; Fortunately we knew how to organize our times and tasks well in the best way; In the end, I was very satisfied with the result and I consider that an excellent job was done.|
|**Dominguez Cervantes Daniel Ivan**|For this last work, the user stories of the first sprint were used. For this occasion, it was necessary to review the user stories one by one, in order to understand each one of them, and based on each story we assigned different tasks. So we met for several hours to agree on the different tasks we assigned were understandable and well written, as well as the preparation of Excel and the Gantt chart. So with this work it was possible to understand how the tasks should be elaborated, as well as the estimation of each one.|
|**Flores Aguila David Antonio**|For reasons of time, we reached the final activity of this subject by carrying out a Burndown of the tasks that we will perform during our first Sprint. It was satisfactory to have had a very positive first progress, although during the presentation we had a point of improvement, at the time of making the pertinent corrections, as well as the advice that the teacher indicated, the work now has a more realistic approach to that of a document of this type in the labor field. While we had to do double the work on the last day to get it ready, we are happy with the result we got.|
|**Valadez Camacho Gustavo**|Dividing each user story into different tasks and assigning them an estimate by time, that is, by hours, allowed us to better analyze the possible dead times that could exist in a workday when working by sprints with the agile SCRUM methodology. This allows to better organize work times and therefore optimize resources. There is also better control by being able to assign a responsable, or responsables, to each specific task. By including the Burndown Chart we can visually notice if we are working within the estimated times that we had at the beginning of the sprint or if there is a delay, this could be of great help to correct the course on time, either by assigning more resources or assigning overtime to complete the remaining tasks, so that we can deliver the full sprint on time.|
|**Vazquez Osuna Laura Michelle**|During the performance of this task it was somewhat overwhelming since, after identifying the tasks we had a long conversation to estimate each one of them, identifying, Which ones need the greatest to least investment time; however in addition to estimating them We also arrange them according to the date for their realization, and that all we will be able to work on them daily.|
