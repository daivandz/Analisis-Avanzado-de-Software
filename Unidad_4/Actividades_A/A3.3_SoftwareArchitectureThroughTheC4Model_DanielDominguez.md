## :books: Conclusions 

|Name|Conclusion|
|---|---|
|**Chavez Lopez Eduardo Guillermo**|Although it may seem simple, the development of the diagrams was overwhelming and difficult, since the behavior and approach that our platform would have represented through a series of descriptive diagrams had to be analyzed, in addition to that, the diagrams had to be very clear and concise, so the information available from our projects had to be used in a good way; But despite the inconveniences, I can say that while it was difficult to find a balance designing the diagrams, it was also satisfying to see that it was looking very good, so I can say that I am very happy with the result and I think what was required was fulfilled.|
|**Dominguez Cervantes Daniel Ivan**|In this work it was a bit complicated, because several doubts were generated about the different elements that could be used in the different diagrams and the connections between each element, also for this work we had to meet on several occasions to be able to agree in what was going to be used in each diagram, since in this way what we want is to show the architecture of our platform.|
|**Flores Aguila David Antonio**|I am glad that this work has only been the realization of some simple diagrams, which serve to give even more shape to our final project. For the first time, I was not able to contribute as much as I would have liked or expected of me, but I am happy to have a team that helped me carry this work forward.|
|**Valadez Camacho Gustavo**|When designing the software architecture with the C4 model, we can explain the way the system works, in this case the DreamCourses platform, being able to detail the information presented in each of the levels depending on how specific the query of said information. Using the first levels to broadly explain the operation of the system and, in a much more detailed way, at the levels 3 (Components) and 4 (Code).|
|**Vazquez Osuna Laura Michelle**|In this work it was complicated to carry out, since we had to make the context diagram and then "zoom in" to one (so as not to need to do all) of each of the components; that is, go to the container, component and class diagram. Although it seemed simple it really was not, there were many complications but in the end we managed to finish the task.|
