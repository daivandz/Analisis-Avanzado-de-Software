## :pencil2: Development

**1. Draw the diagrams for each of the views established in the 4 + 1 architecture model.**

**2. Each diagram must contain at least 3 elements within its representation.**

- :ballot_box_with_check: Use cases (Include at least 5 elements of the diagram)
- :ballot_box_with_check: Sequence diagram (Include at least 5 elements of the diagram)
- :ballot_box_with_check: Class diagrams (Include at least 5 elements of the diagram)
- :ballot_box_with_check: Package diagram containing component diagrams (Include at least 3 - diagram elements)
- :ballot_box_with_check: Distribution diagrams (Include at least 3 elements of the diagram)

**3. Indicate by means of annotations the own technologies that will be used, relying on images or illustrations to represent them.**

## :books: Conclusions 

|Name|Conclusion|
|---|---|
|**Chavez Lopez Eduardo Guillermo**|Although it seemed easy, one of the most difficult parts of this document was precisely to figure out and correctly plan the technologies that we will use in our project, or at least have a vision of what we will use in the development of our project, in the end. I consider that the document proposed here is well detailed and structured, and the best diagrams were taken to fulfill each point requested.|
|**Dominguez Cervantes Daniel Ivan**|Although they are simple annotations. It was necessary to choose the diagrams that were best qualified and from these, we agreed on the different technologies that will be used for the development of the project and with this information it was possible to make the corresponding annotations for each diagram assigned to each member of the team.|
|**Flores Aguila David Antonio**|I honestly don't like making diagrams, but recently I've had to grow fond of it again. By drawing all the diagrams we made in this activity, I was able to provide feedback on my diagramming skills thanks to the feedback from my colleagues. I believe that with each teamwork we do, our schematics and diagrams become even clearer.|
|**Valadez Camacho Gustavo**|Through the use cases, sequence, classes, components and distribution diagrams, each of the views established in the 4+1 architecture model can be perfectly represented, it would only be necessary to add some annotations in which it is reported the kind of technologies to be used. All this means that the functions that are to be represented on the platform are shown in a more detailed and clear way.|
|**Vazquez Osuna Laura Michelle**|During the activity, in addition to collecting the works and comparing them with each other, we had to choose which of them would suit us for the architecture of our program, which diagrams developed we considered best developed, we also had to make sure that those architectures we will implement and develop so that when creating it we have something similar to a guide.|
