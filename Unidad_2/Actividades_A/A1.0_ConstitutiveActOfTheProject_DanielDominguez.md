|Purpose/Justification:|
|---|
|The main objective of the project is to solve the problems of the case study: *Courses and Certifications* of our client and meet the needs of their requests, as well as simplify while contemplating the problems of a project of this type and promote the best results to give the best possible product.|
 
|Brief description of the project:|
|---|
|This project consists primarily of being a course platform, where the * Administrator * will have control of the courses that are managed and authorized, as well as general control; the user type * Teacher * will be able to propose their courses and integrate the necessary tools to teach it (if it is accepted by the area supervisor); while the * Common User * will be the one who can buy and take the courses once their account is created.|
 
|Preliminary scope of the project:|
|---|
|Its initial scope will be towards users with the intention of growing professionally or acquiring extra knowledge in a professional way; initially all courses will be for Spanish-speaking users.|
 
|Expected project results / Benefits:|
|---|
|Users will be able to enjoy any type of course on the platform and be sure to keep their accounts safe, since they will be able to recover the password in case of forgetting it (this via email); In addition, the payment method will be very intuitive and viable for the buyer user, also counting on the fact that the administrator will be able to register and manage the courses taught on the platform, while the teacher will have the ease and flexibility to implement the tools (videos , images, etc.) necessary to propose their course.|
 
|High-level project requirements:||
|---|---|
|**Requirements**|**Success Criteria**|
|Teacher: This user can create and propose courses for the platform through the use of tools and their own experience as a teacher.|Choose good trained teachers.|
|Administrator: The administrator user is the one who will rule the entire system and who will have the last word when coupling or uncoupling courses from the platform.|The administrator or administrators must be pending at all times about the changes or modifications of the platform, as well as the proposed courses.|
|User (market): The common user or rather, our main market, must always have the availability to create an account and manage the courses that can be bought and paid for.|The payment method should always be available so that customers can enjoy their courses and various security methods so that they can keep their accounts easily.|
|Area manager: He is the one who makes sure that the proposed courses are correct and verify if they are suitable for implementation on the platform.|Always have at least one person in charge per area and that this has a constant criterion to evaluate said courses.|
 
|Milestones|
|---|
|- First Milestones: formalize the design that the platform will have; referring to the fact that the minimalist design that was requested is complete in addition to its structure.|
|- Second Milestones: all base systems were implemented; payment methods, courses implementation, different users, among others, it works with excellence.|
|- Third Milestones: the platform is already in place and ready for launch; it is registered on the network and has its own domain independence.|
 
|Risks|
|---|
|One of the biggest risks for the project is that the objectives are not met within the estimated date, as this could delay other objectives; Another important risk is the displeasure of the courses implemented in a preliminary way for the user, since it could affect the quality of the platform; among the latent risks is also the fact of finding teachers willing to collaborate with the platform or that the implementation of the multimedia tools is deficient or does not work 100% before the departure date.|
 
|Estimated Preliminary Cost / Budget|
|---|
|To cover all the factors that make the creation of the project will require a fairly large initial budget; also considering the payment for the employees and the extra work for inconveniences (class investigations, bugs, etc.), which in any software development are palpable. The estimated cost would be between $ 15,000 and $ 20,000.|

## :books: Conclusions 


|Name|Conclusion|
|---|---|
|**Chavez Lopez Eduardo Guillermo**|The constitutive act is one of the most important parts when developing a project, since it defines the most important points of the project and formalizes the work to be done, so that both the work team and the team that will pay for the project are aware of how it will develop; The entire process together with the most general and specific notions about the project's objective are discussed in the constitutive act, in addition to this, the document can also be taken as a future follow-up.|
|**Dominguez Cervantes Daniel Ivan**|With this work of the constitutive act, the important points of our project were specified to carry out in a more orderly and specific way what is necessary for the correct elaboration of the same, therefore the work of each member of the team were reviewed to choose the best drafted and, if possible, make changes or improvements to it, taking into account the other ones, since it is a fundamental part of the project.|
|**Flores Aguila David Antonio**|Throughout my university career I have developed various projects, but it is thanks to this activity that I draw up a constitutive act for the first time. While most of the points had to be filled with fabricated data, many other points made me think from other perspectives. In general, it was not as complicated a job as I thought at first glance, although it was the first time that I had to use new elements in a document such as milestones, risks and the estimate of a budget.I have the faith that this brief exercise will help me to develop projects in a more professional way in the future.|
|**Valadez Camacho Gustavo**|The constitutive act of the project is a very important document for the beginning of any project, by describing the objectives, risks, assumptions, restrictions that may arise, the necessary information can be presented to the different interested parties in the platform so that they may possibly become even more interested in the project, or that some of the initial doubts they may have about it are resolved.|
|**Vazquez Osuna Laura Michelle**|Thanks to this Constitutive Act we can determine the basic and important points for our project, in a clear, simple and summarized way, supporting, in the same way, a follow-up, avoiding crossing the negative imposed points and completing the necessary points foreseen and if possible exceed the expected expectations about the project we present.|
