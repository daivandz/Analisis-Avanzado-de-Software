   **Interview.**

**• Would you like the platform to have different types of user accounts or will always have the standard user?**
*I would like it to be for different types of users, (for the people who develop the courses, for those who give the training, and for those who will receive the training).*

**• What security methods would you want to implement for the user accounts to be secure?**
*User and password (with recovery by alternate mail in case of forgetting it).*

**• Would you like that all types of users to be able to enter and interact with the platform or would he need an account?**
*Only those users who have a registered username and password.*

**• How would you like the design of the platform to be?**
*Minimalist, so that user access may not be complicated.*

**• What kind of certifications and courses would you like to implement?**
*Basics (which all employees must take), technical, operational, specialized and practical (The latter being not an exam but rather an observational one, users must go to their coordinator to be given "the go-ahead"); They are registered manually using excel and the more progress is made in the courses or in their position, more will be added, but these have a one-year expiration, in case of losing it, it must be retaken, and if the course is updated (in case it’s something minor, it’s not necessary), also this update must have a review.*

**• Within the catalog, what information would you like to  display of each course?**
*Who is the course type for, the information expected to be found in the course, and the most current review of the course.*

**• How would you like the courses to be divided within the catalog?**
*I would like them to be according to the category of each role or profile.*

**• What would you like the forms of payment to be for the registration?**
*With credit and debit cards, with paypal as optional.*

**• At any point, do you ever make videos or presentations? And, in what kind of material do you create them?**
*Yes, sometimes we record videos but they are not very heavy, and we do presentations mostly in powerpoint.*

**• Would you like the user to be shown the percentage of the course that is being achieved from the beginning to finish?**
*Definitely yes, so that he knows how much of the course is still missing.*

**• Will the user be able to take the final certification exam / activity as many times as they want until their approval or will they have a limit of attempts?**
*No, in case of failing the exam, the course must be restarted in order to pass it.*

**• Will the courses have scheduled activities or will it be completely self-taught and at the pace that the user wishes?**
*Scheduled, but it may vary depending on the course. Users have a structured training matrix marking the course taken (but they do not depend on any others). This user can take more than one course and even take 2 exams (the exams last around 30 min and is written). However, there must also be a special person (area supervisor) who is dedicated to reviewing the content of their coaches for approval.*

**• At the end of a course (with a successful evaluation), what kind of information or document would you like to be presented to the user?**
*I would like to be able to print a document, card or credential as proof of certification, which are currently the small yellow sheets that the employee brings that are next to the credential to make it easier to read if the person is certified with these courses, it's mostly visual.*

**• Would you like the certificate to be generated automatically upon successful completion of the course, or for the certification to be delivered after a defined time?**
*At the end of the course.*

**• What information about the courses would you like to see shown to the institution? (Ex. Most requested courses, percentage of users who completed the courses, etc.)**
*I would like it to be the most requested courses, the outdated courses, and which users will have the course expired.*

**• How far in advance would you like to be notified that your certification is about to expire?**
*15 days in advance for them to be able to speak with the program coordinator.*

   **Conclutions**
* **Chavez Lopez Eduardo Guillermo:**
  The most difficult part was the development of the requirements since all the requirements had to be deduced and defined from the questions presented in class, in addition to that, we had to define a method to empathize with the client, which although not it was difficult to carry out, if it was very laborious to implement, since each requirement had to be verified to be compatible with the type of method implemented; But not everything was so bad, I learned many things, such as the way to address the client (at least in this interview) and the way to write the questions, adding to this, I understood Design thinking a little more.
  <br>

* **Dominguez Cervantes Daniel Ivan:**  
  In conclusion, in the interview it was possible to obtain the necessary data to be able to define the requirements that were somewhat complicated to write since some were not fully understood, which took us certain to finish them. We chose the method because we concluded among all that it was the one that best suits our case study, the complicated thing was at the time of implementing it with the requirements that we elaborated and with this method we could better understand the requirements of the case of study.
  <br>

* **Flores Aguila David Antonio:**
  The most significant learning I acquired during this research work was trying to adapt our case study to the method of the empathize phase of **Design Thinking**, I had to investigate and compare several examples that I could find on the internet, identify key points and understand them as well as possible, which was a bit complicated because the examples I used as reference were from very different cases from our team, but in the end after discussing the examples among ourselves, we were able to establish the foundations of our work and be able to do it in the most approximate way to what the job requires.
  <br>

 * **Valadez Camacho Gustavo:** 
  The making of the interview is essential to learn more about the requirements that are sought in the platform, since all the functions that are desired are specified here. With the What, How, and Why method, we were able to interpret better the needs of the company so that the platform can satisfy them. Although it is somewhat laborious, it does allow us to understand each requirement in more detail.
  <br>

* **Vazquez Osuna Laura Michelle:**
  Data collection isn’t easy, we must ask a question that is open enough so that the client can be free to express what they want, but this should not be extended since the client will not know what to answer or it could be very ambiguous, but it cannot be so specific because we would not have enough information to meet our requirements. There were many doubts that points mentioned in the interview should be in the requirements, many doubts came up and then our ideas were mixed, until we finally agreed on the completion of the work
